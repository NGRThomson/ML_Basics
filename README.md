# ML_Basics
Machine Learning basics taught in my Machine Learning module at UCL.

Overview of notebooks:

1 - Polynomial fitting and Regression

* Polynomial fitting with least squares on data
* Linear and Logistic Regression on Binary data

2 - SVM - SKLearn

* KFold Cross Validation by hand
* Simple SVM SVC implemented in SKLearn

3 - Adaboost - Numpy

* Full adaboost algorithm implemented in Numpy

4 - NN - Numpy

* Simple feedforward neural net implemented in Numpy

5 - NN - Pytorch

* The same neural net as 4, implemented in Pytorch

6 - CNN - Pytorch

* Convolutional Neural Network implemented in Pytorch

7 - PCA and KMeans - Numpy

* PCA implemented on Mnist dataset
* Kmeans implemented and compared with PCA

8 - Mixture of Gaussians - Numpy

* Mixture of Gaussians implemented with interation by iteration visualisation

9 - Autoencoders - Pytorch

* Multiple Autoencoders implemented with visualisation of results between each
